* One es6 module loader [SystemJS](http://systemjs.com) is using another module loader [Rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup) to optimize their production builds. https://github.com/systemjs/builder/pull/205
* There's a proposal for a `jsnext:main` tag to be included in your package.json to ensure your es6 modules are compatible with stuff like browserify and requirejs: https://github.com/rollup/rollup/wiki/jsnext:main
